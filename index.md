Hello! I am a Quantitative Biology student at USC.

I am hoping to use this blog to document my projects and practice with coding and data analysis!

Check out what I've been doing recently here!

Feel free to use my email below and reach out about anything! Would love to chat about bioinformatics, USC, or whatever!

About me: 

My hometown is Indianapolis, Indiana (Go Purdue!)

I love hiking and have been to 21 National Parks!

I am a Certified Reptile Lover and I have a beautiful leopard gecko named Audrey.
