Hello! I am a Quantitative Biology student at USC.

I am hoping to use this blog to document my projects and practice with coding and data analysis!

Check out my recent projects [here](https://oswhite.github.io/archive.html)!

Feel free to use my email below and reach out about anything! Would love to chat about bioinformatics, USC, or whatever!

About me: 

My hometown is Indianapolis, Indiana (Go Purdue!) 
I love hiking and have been to 21 National Parks! 
I am a Certified Reptile Lover and I have a beautiful leopard gecko named Audrey.
